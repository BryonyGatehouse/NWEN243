# Network Applications

The course provides a broad introduction to computer networks and a basic understanding of network application programming, with an emphasis on the working principles and application of computer networks. It covers a range of topics including basic data communication and computer network concepts, protocols, networked computing concepts and principles, network applications development and network security. The course features an interactive laboratory component with projects examining modern networking technologies such as, GPS enabled mobile phone applications, multimedia and distributed applications. Students are recommended, but not required, to have some familiarity with C programming prior to taking this course.

### Course Content

This course introduces protocols and algorithms for networked and distributed systems. Specific emphasis will be placed on security, application layer protocols, and distributed algorithms.
 
Topics will include:
1. Security, Public Key Cryptography, Authentication and Digital Signatures.
2. Introduction to Networking, Lans, Protocols, the protocol Stack.
3. TCP/IP and the socket API
4. Models of Networked Applications.
5. Media and Application requirements for Networked applications.
6. Application layer case studies: including the Domain Name System (DNS) and Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP)
7. Webservices, SOAP, REST .

### Course Learning Objectives

Students who pass this course will be able to:
1. Explain the basics of networks and the design of their associated protocols.
2. Explain how networks are utilised for various roles.
3. Explain the role of the application layer, the socket API and the basics of building networked or distributed applications and the design of their associated protocols.
4. Implement applications that make use of the Socket API, Webservices (SOAP and REST), and Networked Applications (Android).
